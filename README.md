Below you will find some basic steps to get the front end in this repo operational.

### Installing Node and React Native
- To install Node, please go to [the offical node site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the installer for your OS and follow its wizard.
-   When the install is complete, you may confirm your installation by going to the terminal and entering the command `node --version`. If you get a version number as output you are all set.
-   Next we need to install React Native. To do this, in the terminal enter the command `sudo npm install -g expo-cli`.

### Installing Project Dependencies and Running App

- Once dependencies have finished installing run the command `npm start`  or `expo start` to run the app
- this will pull up a QR code. To view the app you will need to download the Expo client app on your mobile device and scan the QR code there to view the app.
